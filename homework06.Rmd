## Homework 06 - due 11/22/2017

### Logistic Regression

For Homework 06, you will be using the HELP dataset, learn more at:

* [https://melindahiggins2000.github.io/N736Fall2017_HELPdataset/](https://melindahiggins2000.github.io/N736Fall2017_HELPdataset/) &
* [https://github.com/melindahiggins2000/N736Fall2017_HELPdataset](https://github.com/melindahiggins2000/N736Fall2017_HELPdataset)

Refer to the logistic regression analysis example and codes we ran during lesson 18 and 19 - see [https://github.com/melindahiggins2000/N736Fall2017_lesson1819](https://github.com/melindahiggins2000/N736Fall2017_lesson1819)

For the HELP dataset:

* OUTCOME VARIABLE: consider the variable `g1b` "Experienced serious thoughts of suicide (last 30 days) - Baseline"
* PREDICTOR VARIABLE: consider these variables as potential predictors for `g1b`:
    - `age`, `female`, `pss_fr`, `homeless`, `pcs`, `mcs`, `cesd`, `indtot`

Complete the following:

1. Consider the continuous variable `cesd` as a predictor for `g1b`
    a. run a logistic regression of the probability of suicidal thoughts (`g1b`) given their depressive symptoms scores (`cesd`)
    b. make a plot of the the predicted probability of suicidal thoughts (`g1b`) by the depressive symptoms scores (`cesd`)
    c. what value of the `cesd` leads to a probability of suicidal thoughts => 0.5? _(hint: use the plot you just made)_
    
2. Using variable selection methods, develop a logistic regression model for the probability of suicidal thoughts (`g1b`) considering all of these variables for possible inclusion: `age`, `female`, `pss_fr`, `homeless`, `pcs`, `mcs`, `cesd`, `indtot`
    a. present the final model results
    b. write a few sentences describing your results including:
        i. model fit
        ii. model classification table results - remember to report the threshold used for the classification table - you can change it from 0.5 if you think a different threshold might work better
        iii. odds ratios for each significant predictor in the model

## Variables in HELP dataset to be used for Homework 06:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
helpdata <- readRDS("helpmkh.rds")
library(tidyverse)
sub1 <- helpdata %>%
  select(g1b, age, female, pss_fr,
         homeless, pcs, mcs, cesd, indtot)

# create a function to get the label
# label output from the attributes() function
getlabel <- function(x) attributes(x)$label
# getlabel(sub1$age)

library(purrr)
ldf <- purrr::map_df(sub1, getlabel) # this is a 1x15 tibble data.frame
# t(ldf) # transpose for easier reading to a 15x1 single column list

# using knitr to get a table of these
# variable names for Rmarkdown
library(knitr)
knitr::kable(t(ldf),
             col.names = c("Variable Label"),
             caption="Use these variables from HELP dataset for Homework 06")

```
