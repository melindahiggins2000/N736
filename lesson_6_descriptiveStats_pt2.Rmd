## Lesson 06: Descriptive (Univariate) Stats

This lesson focuses on describing and summarizing data using univariate stats. We will be working with the H.E.L.P. dataset.

## The HELP Dataset 

For today and several future lessons, we'll be working with the HELP (Health Evaluation and Linkage to Primary Care) dataset. You can learn more about this dataset at [https://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/sasr2/datasets.php](https://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/sasr2/datasets.php). This dataset is also used by Ken Kleinman and Nicholas J. Horton for their book "SAS and R: Data Management, Statistical Analysis, and Graphics" _(which is another helpful textbook)_.
