For all students in this course, I have created a learners group "NRSG 736 Quantitative Analysis Fall 2020" for education at [https://www.datacamp.com/](https://www.datacamp.com/). You should all have received an invitation to join this group at Datacamp.

While enrolled you will have access to the Datacamp catalog which currently includes 330+ courses on R, Python, SQL and other programming courses for 6 months for free.

There are numerous skill tracks and career tracks that are helpful to follow.
